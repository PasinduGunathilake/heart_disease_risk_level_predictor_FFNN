# Heart Disease Risk Level Predictor (FFNN Web Application)

This repository contains a web application for predicting heart disease risk levels using a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) model. The application leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and provide an estimated risk level of heart disease.

## Project Description

The heart_disease_risk_level_predictor_FFNN_webapplication is designed to help users assess the risk of heart disease based on various health parameters. By entering relevant data, users can obtain a prediction generated by a trained FFNN model.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for data input
- Machine learning model (FFNN) for prediction
- Visualization of prediction results
- Built using Jupyter Notebook, Python, HTML, and CSS

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** (main development environment)
- **Python** (modeling and backend logic)
- **HTML & CSS** (frontend interface)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Recommended: Virtual environment (venv, conda, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PasinduGunathilake/heart_disease_risk_level_predictor_FFNN.git
    cd heart_disease_risk_level_predictor_FFNN
    ```

2. Install required dependencies (if a requirements.txt is provided):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If not, install popular libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, etc.

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the main notebook file and follow the instructions to run the application.

## Usage

- Open the notebook in Jupyter.
- Follow the steps to preprocess data, train the model, and use the predictor.
- Enter patient data in the provided interface to get a risk prediction.
